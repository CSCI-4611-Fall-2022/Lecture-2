# Lecture 2: Anatomy of a Graphics Program

Detailed explanation of this code can be found in the lecture video (will be added after class).

You can run the program on [GitHub pages](https://csci-4611-fall-2022.github.io/Lecture-2).

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

I also recommend you install the following useful VS Code extensions:

- GitLens (makes source control easier)
- ESLint (static code analysis tool that can flag errors)
- JavaScript Debugger (essential for real-time debugging)
- WebGL GLSL Editor (used for programming shaders later in the course)

## Topics

- Installation and setup
- Structure of a graphics program
- Introduction to TypeScript
- Drawing basic shapes with GopherGfx
- Event handlers
- Debugging errors
- Submitting assignments using GitHub Classroom

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Webpack should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
